                Welcome to Mazedan Transactions on Engineering Systems
                Design (MTESD), a quarterly publication established in
                2020 by Mazedan International Research Academy. Journal
                serves as a premier, fully refereed international forum in
                the dynamic field of design engineering. Published on the
                Digital Library (MDL) platform and utilizing the Mazedan

                offers a comprehensive platform for sharing high-quality
                research outcomes, showcasing new developments, and
                exploring innovative approaches in optimizations, control,
                smart materials, structure design, and the utilization of
                computer and IT tools for engineering system development.
                The journal is indexed by Google Scholar and providing a
                unique DOI to each article, MTESD publishes research and
                review articles, as well as extended versions of
                conference presentations. Employing a hybrid mode for

                <p data-aos="fade-up">Mazedan Journals strictly prohibit plagiarism, defined as the unethical use of someone else's ideas, processes, or words without proper acknowledgment. We employ Turnitin/iThenticate software to meticulously check submitted anuscripts for plagiarism. Detected instances during the initial review lead to prompt rejection. Post-publication plagiarism discoveries prompt comprehensive investigations, and retractions are implemented if necessary. Our policy allows a maximum of 20% plagiarism and 40% in the case of self-plagiarism. However, parametric data and approaches must not be plagiarized in either case. It is essential to cite references for all content to avoid policy violations</p>
